Services are an abstraction that sit one level above pods, acting as a director between individual pods and the outside world.

Services are also convenient when creating complex, interdependent programs as they set a single Domain Name Service (DNS) record for all pods within their service. Another part of the program, a deployment (see below), can then use this DNS name to access information from these pods without needing to know the IP addresses for each.

In other words, another part of the program can connect to this pod group through the shared DNS record without needing to track status or information of each pod.

Group based access allows for greater flexibility than individual access as pods can be added or removed from the service group without code revision.

Rolling Back a Deployment


kubectl describe pod nginx-deployment-64cccc48c6-6q7zq


kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o jsonpath="{.items[*].spec.containers[*].image}" |\
tr -s '[[:space:]]' '\n' |\
sort |\
uniq -c


kubectl config use-context minikube
kubectl config view --minify -o jsonpath='{.clusters[].name}'


kubectl rollout status deployment nginx-deployment
