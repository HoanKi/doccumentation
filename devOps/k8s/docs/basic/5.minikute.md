Minikube
The first of our additional tools, Minikube creates a virtual testing ground for all your containerized programs. When run, Minikube creates a Virtual Machine (VM) on your computer which will simulate the behavior of a physical system without the risk of making unwanted changes to your machine.

This VM is a simple single-node cluster, meaning that it behaves like a group of computers with only one machine hooked up. This simplified cluster form and simulated behavior make Minikube the perfect development and testing environment for unfinished programs or for simply learning container-based programming.

While this is ideal for Linux and Mac users, Windows users may have a hard time getting it started. For Windows, instead, try Docker Desktop; it has the same test environment functionality with a simpler fit into Windowsâ€™ infrastructure.
