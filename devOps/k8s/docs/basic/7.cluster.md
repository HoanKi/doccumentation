Kubernetes Cluster

Clusters are groups of servers all working together as a system toward the same goal. These servers are commonly referred to as nodes and can each work on independent tasks which culminate to accomplishing the system’s goal.

Each cluster has a list of conditions defined in its config files which the cluster expects in order to run correctly, known as a “desired state”. This state could feature specifications such as which workloads should be running, container images the cluster will need access to, or hardware resources that should be available on a given machine.
