Deployments

Our final component of Kubernetes, Deployments, takes the hassle out of upgrading pods. Normally, when upgrading a system, one would have to shut off all old instances then reboot the system using the upgraded instances, resulting in a period of downtime.

Kubernetes’ deployments allow us to sidestep this problem by allowing for “rolling updates” during which pods are taken down one-by-one, upgraded to the new version, and verified as functional before moving onto the next.

In doing so, Kubernetes ensures that not only is there no downtime but also that each pod is upgraded as it should. This process can also be repeated in the opposite order should the new program contain an error, resulting in an automated rollback to the previous version.
